Tool for viewing some event websites and generating ICS files


This is a very basic tool, the purpose is firstly for my own private use, secondly, to demonstrate the idea, because I imagine that this could be executed on a larger scale. That's the main reason why I implemented the system for generating ICS files.

This tool is very incomplete, it doesn't generate ICS files for all the websites that it can display, that's because I don't need it for my personal use, and think that  for the puprose of demonstrating the potential, its enough that it can generate ICS files for just some of the websites.
